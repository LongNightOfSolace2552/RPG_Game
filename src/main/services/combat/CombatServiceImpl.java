/*
implementation of CombatService.

win chance is additive across both Strength and Magic, rather than
picking a single axis by weapon style: each stat is compared against the
enemy's same stat independently (its own threshold/immunity/floor/ceiling,
all at half-scale), and the two resulting chances are added together.

this means a player heavily invested in one stat can still win against an
enemy who threatens mainly on the other stat, just at a reduced chance
compared to actually matching the enemy's relevant stat, since an enemy
stat of 0 on an axis is immune there (a big number on that axis does not
help) and a real deficit on the other axis still drags the total down.
when both axes are simultaneously at parity, the two halves sum back to
the same 66% "full match" value the single-axis model used.

agility plays no part in this threshold, it is purely a dodge stat,
layered on afterward exactly as before: a ratio of agility against the
opponent's total offensive stats, contributing to both the player's own
dodge and the enemy's dodge on the player.

the outcome (win or loss, and how favorable it was) is narrated through
DialogueService, which picks templated lines by StatState rather than a
fixed hardcoded line every time.
